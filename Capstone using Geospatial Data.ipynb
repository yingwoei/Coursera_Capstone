    "## Introduction: Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto, as the largest metropolitan areas in Canada, is very diverse and is the financial captials of Canada. The exciting employment opportunities have attracted many Canadians and immigrants to migrate to Toronto, especially the millennials of age 22 and 37 years old. According to UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index in 2019, Toronto is ranked number 2 for the the greatest risk of a housing bubble and being the most overpriced cities in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the steeply inflating housing markets, many millennials are not able to afford living in Toronto. They are forced to live in the suburbs of Ontario and spend many hours commuting to the city for work. According to Statistics Canada, the millennial cohort had a median after-tax household income of CAD 44,093 in 2016.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I am interested in investigating whether or not there are still neighbourhoods suitable and affordable for millennials to live in Toronto. A good old rule of thumb is that we shouldn't be spending more than 30 percent of our income on rent. Therefore, I will assess whether neighbourhoods with average rent less than CAD 13230 a year or CAD 1102 a month. In this project, I hope to help provide some insights to millennials by recommending suitable neighbourhoods to them. I will focus on millenials that are only looking for a bachelor's unit. In addition to rent, I will also utilize Foursquare API to determine the first 100 venues closest to each neighbourhood. I will perform K-Means clustering to cluster them based on categories. Lastly, I will conclude the ideal neighbourhoods by taking rent, infrastructure around the neighbourhood, such as TTC stations, hospitals, police stations, and restaurants into account."

This is probably because they are not rated by users and hence did not appear in the top 10 venues. More work can be done on this in the future by using FourSquare API to determine top 10 closest venues to the neighborhoods, which might take accessible to transport into account."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, since TTC subway stations are not included, other infrastructure and diversity of restaurants, and how close they are to Toronto are used in making the decision instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend millennials to rent in neighborhoods that are close to downtown Toronto with diverse venues selection, so that they don't necessarily need to commute to downtown Toronto for entertainment. As a millennial myself, I am more inclined to rent from neighborhoods in Cluster 1, such as Yonge-Eglinton, Bayview, King, Cabbage Town, Regent Park, The Beaches, and Greenwood-Coxwell. Nevertheless, I'd still recommend neighborhoods from Cluster 2 for millennials to consider. They are Little Portugal, Danforth Village, Kennedy Park, Downsview, King West, Eglinton East."
