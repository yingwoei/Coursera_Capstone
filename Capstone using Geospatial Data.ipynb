            "source": "## Introduction: Business Problem\n\nToronto, as the largest metropolitan areas in Canada, is very diverse and is the financial captials of Canada. The exciting employment opportunities have attracted many Canadians and immigrants to migrate to Toronto, especially the millennials of age 22 and 37 years old. According to UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index in 2019, Toronto is ranked number 2 for the the greatest risk of a housing bubble and being the most overpriced cities in the world.\n\nBecause of the steeply inflating housing markets, many millennials are not able to afford living in Toronto. They are forced to live in the suburbs of Ontario and spend many hours commuting to the city for work. According to Statistics Canada, the millennial cohort had a median after-tax household income of $44,093 in 2016.   \n\nIn this project, I am interested in investigating whether or not there are still neighbourhoods suitable and affordable for millennials to live in Toronto. A good old rule of thumb is that we shouldn't be spending more than 30% of our income on rent. Therefore, I will assess whether neighbourhoods with average rent less than $13230 a year or $1102 a month. In this project, I will focus on millenials that are only looking for a bachelor's unit. In addition to rent, I will also utilize Foursquare API to determine the first 100 venues closest to each neighbourhood. I will perform K-Means clustering to cluster them based on categories. Lastly, I will conclude the ideal neighbourhoods by taking rent, infrastructure around the neighbourhood, such as TTC stations, hospitals, police stations, and restaurants into account.",
